Welcome to #hashIt!

#hashIt is a search tool application. You can use it to quickly find instagram
photos of a specific category (i.e sports, outdoors, san francisco, biking). 
When a user signs up, they unlock the feature to click on images and save them
to their 'Favorites' collection. Once a collection has been made, the user can modify
or delete favorited items out the list.

Technologies used: 

1) Node/express, 
2) mongo/mongoose, 
3) Instagram APIs, 
4) jQuery/AJAX, 
5) Bootstrap, 
6) other front end libraries.

Steps to run locally: 
1) clone repo (https://github.com/joshlbaker/project_1.git)
2) npm install 
3) Request the CLIENT_ID from Instagram's endpoints page (https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/)
4) Run server on localhost:3000
